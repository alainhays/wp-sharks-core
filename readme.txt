The WP Sharks Core is a WordPress plugin that serves as a framework for other plugins by WP Sharks™.

== Description ==

This plugin (by itself) does nothing. The plugin serves as a framework for other plugins by WP Sharks™; i.e., it contains code that can be resused by other small plugins developed by the WP Sharks™ team. Instead of shipping each small plugin with the full framework, this framework satisfies that dependency for all other plugins we develop.

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation (Recommended) =

Wait until you're prompted; i.e., when prompted by another plugin developed by WP Sharks™, this core framework can be installed automatically from inside your WordPress Dashboard by following the prompts given; i.e., to satisfy a dependency that another plugin has. For instance, a plugin which requires this framework will let you know that our framwork is required. At that time you can install it on-demand.

= Manual Installation (Optional) =

1. Upload the `/wp-sharks-core` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress®.
3. _Now, feel free to activate another plugin which depends on this one._

== Software Requirements ==

In addition to the [WordPress Requirements](http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/), The WP Sharks™ Core framework requires:

- PHP 7.0.1+

== Changelog ==

= v160216 =

- Initial release.
